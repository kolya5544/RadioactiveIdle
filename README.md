Radioactive Idle is an incremental game about chain reactions and nuclear fission. Get your reactor to generate precious Energy, convert it to usable Heat, and make sure it doesn't **explode ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥**

Original PoC idea by https://github.com/bluecheetah001/ChainReaction

## Access it now!

The project is in *open beta* and might have a lot of bugs. The game runs in your browser. You can access it here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolya5544/RadioactiveIdle/master/atom.png](https://nk.ax/radioactive/)

## Gameplay
#### *[SPOILERS AHEAD!! Proceed with some sort of caution...]*

Start your Energy generation with your first click! From here, you can explode atoms and upgrade your reactor to gain Energy. The more atoms are exploded in a chain, the more Energy you'll get!

After several upgrades, you should be able to start a chain reaction - keep it going by purchasing new upgrades. Get the longest chain reaction you can before you have to Sacrifice your entire progress to get a trace amount of Heat... Repeat the never-ending cycle, collecting all the achievements along the way. Hooray!

Current stages of the game include:
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
1. Pre-Sacrifice. That's where you begin the game (`0 - 695 000 E`)
   - Pre-chain reaction. (`0 - ~5000 E`)
   - Post-chain reaction. That's where you are getting a stable chain reaction enough to carry you to unlocking Sacrifice. (`~5000 - 695000+ E`)
2. Post-Sacrifice. You begin gathering up Heat and increasing your Energy output (`0 - 1000 HP`)
   - Pre-Extraction. You don't yet have the proper means of increasing your Heat production (`0 - 200 HP`)
   - Post-Extraction. Your Heat output is greatly increased, allowing you to reach new heights easily (`200 - 1000 HP`)
3. Meltdown. The reaction rapidly and passively generates Energy (`1000 - 5000 HP`)
4. Destroy the reactor. You destroy the reactor for trace amount of Matter Units (`5000+ HP`, `1 - 1000 MU`)
   - Pre-External Intake. You use tickspeed and multiplier upgrades to buff up your Energy and Heat Point production greatly. (`1 - ~16 MU`)
   - Pre-69420 HP. Gradually obtain Rapid Delay and other valuable upgrades. (`~16 - ~40 MU`)
   - Automata. Get Heat Control System and obtain the achievements to unlock automatic upgrade buyer. Start passive HP production (`~40 - 1000 MU`)
5. Endgame (`1000+ MU`). Obtain generic Matter Unit upgrades, eventually reaching sextillions of Energy and trillions of Heat Points.
